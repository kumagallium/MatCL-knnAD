## Introduction
Materials informatics (MI) research, which is the discovery of new materials through machine learning (ML) using large-scale material data, has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, in general, the large-scale material data used in MI are biased owing to differences in the targeted material domains. Moreover, most studies on MI have not clearly demonstrated the influence of data bias on ML models. In this study, we clarify the influence of data bias on ML models by combining the concept of the applicability domain and clustering for large-scale experimental property data in the Starrydata2 material database previously developed by our group.
